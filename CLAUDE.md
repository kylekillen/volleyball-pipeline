# Volleyball Pipeline — Personal OS Division

**STOP.** This project is managed by Personal OS.

## If you're seeing this...

You launched Claude from `~/volleyball-pipeline/` directly. The full context, status, and instructions live in Google Drive.

**To work on this project correctly:**
1. Close this session
2. Launch from: `Personal-OS/Code/volleyball-pipeline/Launch Volleyball Pipeline.command`
3. Or: `cd ~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-kyle.killen@gmail.com/My\ Drive/Personal-OS/Code/volleyball-pipeline && claude`

## Why?

Personal OS is the "company" that manages all of Kyle's projects. Volleyball Pipeline is a division. The source code lives here (for git/deployment), but all context, decisions, and status tracking live in Drive so they're backed up and accessible from anywhere.

## Emergency: Drive not available?

If you're recovering from a failure and Drive isn't synced yet:

1. This source code came from: `https://github.com/kylekillen/volleyball-pipeline`
2. No secrets required for this project
3. Get Google Drive syncing first, then launch from there

## Quick reference (if you must work here)

```bash
open index.html              # Preview locally
python3 -m http.server 8000  # Local server
```

But please launch from Drive for full context.
